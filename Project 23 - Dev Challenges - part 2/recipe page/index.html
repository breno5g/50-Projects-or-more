            <h1>Classic Cheesecake Recipe</h1>
            <p>
                Look no further for a creamy and ultra smooth classic cheesecake
                recipe! Paired with a buttery graham cracker crust, no one can
                deny its simple decadence. For the best results, bake in a water
                bath.

                                processor, pulse the graham crackers into
                                crumbs. Pour into a medium bowl and stir in
                                sugar and melted butter until combined. (You can
                                also pulse it all together in the food
                                processor.) Mixture will be sandy. Press firmly
                                into the bottom and slightly up the sides of a
                                9-inch or 10-inch springform pan. No need to
                                grease the pan first. I use the bottom of a
                                measuring cup to pack the crust down tightly.
                                Pre-bake for 8 minutes. Remove from the oven and
                                place the hot pan on a large piece of aluminum
                                foil. The foil will wrap around the pan for the
                                water bath in step 4. Allow crust to slightly
                                cool as you prepare the filling.

                                together on medium-high speed in a large bowl
                                until the mixture is smooth and creamy, about 2
                                minutes. Add the sour cream, vanilla extract,
                                and lemon juice then beat until fully combined.
                                On medium speed, add the eggs one at a time,
                                beating after each addition until just blended.
                                After the final egg is incorporated into the
                                batter, stop mixing. To help prevent the
                                cheesecake from deflating and cracking as it
                                cools, avoid over-mixing the batter as best you
                                can.

                                </span>
                                Boil a pot of water. You need 1 inch of water in
                                your roasting pan for the water bath, so make
                                sure you boil enough. I use an entire kettle of
                                hot water. As the water is heating up, wrap the
                                aluminum foil around the springform pan. Pour
                                the cheesecake batter on top of the crust. Use a
                                rubber spatula or spoon to smooth it into an
                                even layer. Place the pan inside of a large
                                roasting pan. Carefully pour the hot water
                                inside of the pan and place in the oven. (Or you
                                can place the roasting pan in the oven first,
                                then pour the hot water in. Whichever is easier
                                for you.)

                                Bake cheesecake for 55-70 minutes or until the
                                center is almost set. When it’s done, the center
                                of the cheesecake will slightly wobble if you
                                gently shake the pan. Turn the oven off and open
                                the oven door slightly. Let the cheesecake sit
                                in the oven in the water bath as it cools down
                                for 1 hour. Remove from the oven and water bath,
                                then cool cheesecake completely at room
                                temperature. Then refrigerate the cheesecake for
                                at least 4 hours or overnight.
